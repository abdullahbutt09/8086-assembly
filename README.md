# ğŸ§  8086 Assembly Practice

Welcome to my personal collection of 8086 assembly programs!  
This repository contains my learning exercises, experiments, and notes  
as I explore the fundamentals of low-level programming and CPU architecture.

## ğŸ“˜ Topics Covered
- MOV instruction and register operations
- Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, INC, DEC)
- Interrupts (INT 21H)
- Memory access
- Loops and branching

## ğŸ›  Tools
- **EMU8086** (main emulator)
- **Online Assembler BC** for quick testing
